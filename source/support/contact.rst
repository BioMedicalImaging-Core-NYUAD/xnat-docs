Support Request Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Good Example:**
```
Subject: Cannot upload DICOM files - validation error

Hello,

I'm having trouble uploading DICOM files to project XYZ. When I try to upload a session, I get the error message "Invalid DICOM format - missing required tags."

Steps I've tried:
1. Validated DICOM files with external tools
2. Tried uploading individual files
3. Checked file permissions
4. Tested with different browser

The files upload successfully to other projects, so this seems specific to project XYZ.

Browser: Chrome 91.0.4472.124
OS: Windows 10
File types: DICOM (.dcm)
Project: XYZ-2023-001

Screenshots attached.

Thanks for your help!
```

**Poor Example:**
```
Subject: Help!

XNAT is broken and I can't upload anything. Please fix it ASAP.
```
