===============


XNAT contains multiple projects that contain:
   * Raw data (e.g. DICOMs)
   * Preprocessed data

Raw data is uploaded into the appropriate scan session (arranged by scan date), and placed under a unique subject identifier (i.e. sub-0100). Subjects can be found under different projects, as shown in the screenshot below:
